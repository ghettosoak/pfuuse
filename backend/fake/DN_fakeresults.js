        comment: "It occurs to me that websites these days are all becoming homogenized… Perhaps as a result of everyone using the same few frameworks or prototyping with the same pre-defined UI kits and themes. They are all (all is obviously an exaggeration) adding up to a rather dull web experience. Whatever you say about Flash it was a very expressive medium. So I ask you… what are the best and most expressive sites you've seen. Let's post some experimental websites here… (and building stuff out of CSS doesn't count). Where's the Joshua Davis' of this era?",

        comment: "Hi all, I have been working on this for a couple weeks with my buddy @kasperjj and wanted to show you all and get your feedback. You can try it here: http://boomstat.works Here is the medium article about it. https://medium.com/@wtrsld/boomstat-c027f15f6345 TL;DR This is a quick and easy tool to visualize data so that you can share it up and out. Main reason we made this is that at a company that calls itself a \"data - driven \" company it is very hard to spacial understand data when it is in bullet points or it just looks shitty in an excel graph. So we made Boomstat. What I would like from you is to maybe either pass it on to someone you think could use it or try it yourself and let me know how it works for you. This is kind of weird to make a product in the wild but doing so will give us better feedback than we could have gotten on our own, talking to our friends. What we are working on right now: - Getting examples up so it is easier to know how to use it. - Getting more ways to format data for people. - Working on a \" Download \" link for the created visual so you don't have to screenshot each one. anything else????
